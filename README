TODO:

4. Add Russian translations

8. When date is changed inside new-event element - do fetch new events
11. check the allowed events logic on history editing

12. Filter on list by event type "DISAPPEARED"

new variety -> can not choose sport of (only new, with edit all ok)
(it is bug with pressing + button without chosen variant)

pagination is not working
we should not have possibility to create exemplar without variety name

a lot of incorrect picture requests in console

add slider to history to see how it was

remove possibility to add null date to exemplar history as it will break sorting by date

exemplar search by variety doesn't work

add concept of group photo

when exemplar update current event type should be default!

add exemplar number to display (id)
